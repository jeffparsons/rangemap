nightly = []
# Enables `RangeMap::new()`, `RangeInclusiveMap::new()`, `RangeSet::new()`,
# and `RangeInclusiveSet::new()` to be const functions.
# Requires a nightly compiler because `const_btree_new` is an unstable feature,
# but is soon to be stabilized: <https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/71835>
